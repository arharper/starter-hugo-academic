abstract: Genome-wide association studies have established the contribution of
  common and low frequency variants to metabolic biomarkers in the UK Biobank
  (UKB); however, the role of rare variants remains to be assessed
  systematically. We evaluated rare coding variants for 198 metabolic
  biomarkers, including metabolites assayed by Nightingale Health, using exome
  sequencing in participants from four genetically diverse ancestries in the UKB
  (N=412,394). Gene-level collapsing analysis – that evaluated a range of
  genetic architectures – identified a total of 1,303 significant relationships
  between genes and metabolic biomarkers (p<1x10-8 10 ), encompassing 207
  distinct genes. These include associations between rare non-synonymous
  variants in GIGYF1 and glucose and lipid biomarkers, SYT7 and creatinine, and
  others, which may provide insights into novel disease biology. Comparing to a
  previous microarray-based genotyping study in the same cohort, we observed
  that 40% of gene-biomarker relationships identified in the collapsing analysis
  were novel. Finally, we applied Gene-SCOUT, a novel tool that utilises the
  gene-biomarker association statistics from the collapsing analysis to identify
  genes having similar biomarker fingerprints and thus expand our understanding
  of gene networks.
