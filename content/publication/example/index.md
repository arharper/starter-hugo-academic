abstract: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a common, serious, genetic heart
  disorder. Rare pathogenic variants in sarcomere genes cause HCM, but with
  unexplained phenotypic heterogeneity. Moreover, most patients do not carry
  such variants. We report a genome-wide association study of 2,780 cases and
  47,486 controls that identified 12 genome-wide-significant susceptibility loci
  for HCM. Single-nucleotide polymorphism heritability indicated a strong
  polygenic influence, especially for sarcomere-negative HCM (64% of cases;
  h2g = 0.34 ± 0.02). A genetic risk score showed substantial influence on the
  odds of HCM in a validation study, halving the odds in the lowest quintile and
  doubling them in the highest quintile, and also influenced phenotypic severity
  in sarcomere variant carriers. Mendelian randomization identified diastolic
  blood pressure (DBP) as a key modifiable risk factor for sarcomere-negative
  HCM, with a one standard deviation increase in DBP increasing the HCM risk
  fourfold. Common variants and modifiable risk factors have important roles in
  HCM that we suggest will be clinically actionable.

summary: The largest genome-wide association study of hypertrophic
  cardiomyopathy performed identified 12 loci underpinning disease
  susceptibility and enabled diastolic blood pressure to be recognised as a
  causal driver for disease.
